Put your Project 5 brief explanation, as directed, here.

I am accessing the Twitter search API and gathering:
- I am going to search for 30 tumblr blogs for each of 2 NBA teams:
Official Tumblr Feed for the Golden State Warriors
Official Tumblr Feed for the Cleveland Cavaliers
- For each blog, I'll be accessing the blog name, blog id, post url, blog type(text/photo/..) and post date
- I'll write 2 CSV files, one for each team's search
- Data in each CSV file: 4 columns -- blog_name,id,post_url,type,date
- URL for the API: <https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#hostname>
- If necessary, URL describing the authentication process for the API: oauth1
